# Solutions

This repo contains solutions for the adventofcode.com 2021 challenges.
The solutions are written in Haskell.
To run the solutions, compile the Main.hs files using GHC and give the program
a file with your data.

# Parsec

Some solutions utilize the Parsec library to parse files.
To install, make sure to [install cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/#:~:text=To%20install%20the%20cabal%20executable,binary%20from%20the%20Download%20page.)
Then, use `cabal install parsec` to install Parsec.
